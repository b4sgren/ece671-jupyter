    "singular values. SVD is a generalization of Eigenvalue Decomposition\n",
    "and is valid for any complex matrix, not just square matrices.\n",

    "SVD is one of the most important techniques of Linear Algebra \n",
    "(to the point that it could be called a power tool!) and for good reason.\n",
    "The SVD provides a robust solution to Least Squares and Min-Norm problems.\n",
